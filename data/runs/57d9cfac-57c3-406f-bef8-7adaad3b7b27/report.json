    "Cognitive Mimicry\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** AI systems demonstrate superior performance in specific, well-defined, and narrow tasks, often surpassing human benchmarks in speed and consistency; however, this performance is typically achieved through statistical pattern matching and computational power rather than human-like understanding or reasoning, and its robustness and generalizability beyond curated datasets remain limited",
    "*   **Rationale:** This hypothesis acknowledges the undeniable successes of AI in domains like strategic games and certain classification tasks, where clear metrics and abundant data allow for high-performance optimization",
    "However, it critically integrates the observation that this \"human-level\" or \"superior\" performance is often functional and metric-driven, not indicative of human-like cognitive processes such as common sense or ethical reasoning"
