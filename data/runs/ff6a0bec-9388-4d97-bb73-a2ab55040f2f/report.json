    "Objective Impact on Language Learning Outcomes\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** Advanced English language learners *perceive* mobile devices as highly advantageous for accessing learning resources, fostering autonomy, and facilitating both formal and informal study; however, these self-reported perceptions require validation through objective measures of language proficiency and clearly operationalized criteria for \"support\" and \"facilitation\" to establish their demonstrable effectiveness on actual learning outcomes",
    "*   **Rationale:** The Reader's analysis highlights that \"Subjects demonstrated heightened awareness of the advantageous role of mobile devices in their learning endeavors\" (EJ1172284",
    "pdf, Main Findings), and that devices \"support learner autonomy and independence\" (EJ1172284",
    "pdf, Key Concepts, chunk48) and \"facilitate both formal and informal English language study\" (EJ1172284"
