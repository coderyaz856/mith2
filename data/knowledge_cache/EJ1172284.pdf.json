  "summary": "This research investigates how advanced English language learners utilize mobile devices for their studies, drawing insights from interview data. The study, involving 20 students, employed semi-structured interviews followed by qualitative and quantitative analysis. Key findings indicate that learners possess a strong awareness of the advantageous role mobile devices play in their learning processes. They effectively use these devices to find suitable tools, retrieve information, and adapt their English learning to personal styles, often demonstrating an intuitive or ad hoc approach in the classroom. This highlights the potential of mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, for fostering individualized learning, learner autonomy, and independent practice through access to mobile apps and internet resources."
